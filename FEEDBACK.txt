FEEDBACK:

For future, consider more clearly defining what each partner’s contribution should be.
        This doesn’t have to be set in concrete and plan on being flexible.
	Indeed team projects usually take more time as they require coordination between team members.
	In return, you can more easily build more complex interesting projects,
	projects that perhaps you'd want to include in your future resume.


-1 Incomplete implementation of class GraphView and paintComponent()
   does not correctly draw the y-axis label. This required
   you to investigate and post questions on how to rotate graphics state.


-1 Incomplete task description posted on 03/03.
	An overview and lists of tasks and their authors is necessary for me to 
	accurately evaluate the contribution of each team member.
	
	
Extra Credit Opportunity 1:
+3 Excellent job of investing and implementing of a scrollable legend panel!

   Good further investigation of implementing a scrollable graph panel.
   However, consider how much it adds to the readability of the graph.
